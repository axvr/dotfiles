- Vim:
  - Better learn to use marks and registers.
  - `:h shada-file`
  - Finish arglist bookmarks plugin.  Publish?
  - Alternate REPL plugins?  Zepl, Zepl2, Something Tmux-based?
    - Restore Zepl REPL configs from commit `67395567abeff763ba50f6c52bb0a1ff04db3bdd`
    - Conjure's jump to source (incl. Java source) is useful.
    - Common Lisp, Clojure, Julia, Elixir need interactive REPL TUIs with mouse support which Conjure doesn't do well.
  - Create an execline plugin <https://skarnet.org/software/execline/>
    - vim-execline is closed source and cannot be included in Vim.
    - Open Web docs binding or include links in Vim help doc?

- Scripts:
  - Clojure equivalent to my HyperSpec command (+ `<C-K>` Vim mapping).
    - <https://clojuredocs.org/>, <https://cljdoc.org/>

- Vim:
  - Better learn to use marks and registers.
  - `:h shada-file`
  - Arglist bookmarks + helpers.  (Name: Argbook, Barge, Darg?)
    - Convert into a plugin?
  - REPL plugins?  Conjure, Zepl, Zepl2, Something Tmux-based?
    - Conjure's jump to source (incl. Java source) is useful.
    - Conjure's REPL currently sucks for Common Lisp, a plain REPL is better.
      - Common Lisp (and Clojure) need interactive REPL TUIs with mouse support.
        - Similar to what Julia has.
        - Maybe an idea for Vila?
    - Conjure: add Zepl's `gz` binding?
  - `<C-K>` binding to lookup symbol in ClojureDocs or Javadoc?
  - Plugins to create?
    - execline.vim?   <https://skarnet.org/software/execline/>
      - vim-execline is closed source.
      - Add/open links to the Web manual?
      - Include in Vim?
    - netstring.vim?  <https://cr.yp.to/proto/netstrings.txt>

- Tmux:
  - Add tmux-restore script.

- Scripts:
  - CljDoc equivalent to my HyperSpec command.
    - <https://clojuredocs.org/>, <https://cljdoc.org/>

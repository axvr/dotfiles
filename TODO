- Vim
  - Conjure: add Zepl's `gz` binding?
  - Clojure-LSP?
  - Find replacement for Apart.vim
    - Need to bring back lispy J (respect Neovim's `joinspaces` opt)
    - Or rewrite in legacy Vim script?
  - Add custom `gx` mapping.
  - Keep a minimal Vim config (share some with Neovim?)
  - `<C-K>` binding to lookup symbol in HyperSpec, ClojureDocs or Javadoc?
- CljDoc equivalent to my HyperSpec command.
